# flvConverter
flvConverter | Version 1.0 | 12.06.2016

this is a small bash/shell script which will convert
all .flv files in a given folder to .avi file.

to run this converter properly you need the ffmpeg package installed.

after cloning/downloading type "chmod +x install.sh".
now you can run the setup with "./install.sh".
the installer only needs 1 input - thats all.

pleae feel free to comment.
