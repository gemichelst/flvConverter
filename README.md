# flvConverter
Version 1.0 - build 12062016
coded by gemichelst (https://github.com/gemichelst/flvConverter)

this is a small bash/shell script which will convert
all .flv files in a given folder to .avi file.

- to run this converter properly you need the ffmpeg package installed.
- after cloning/downloading type "chmod +x install.sh".
- now you can run the setup with "./install.sh".

the installer only needs the path to the folder which includes .flv files.
thats all.

usage: find-conver-flv /path/to/flv/files
